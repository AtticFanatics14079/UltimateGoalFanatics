- Test ConfigurationRR
- Test Odometry
- At this point, clean up recording and re-running software. Should not be much work, but optimize and use new DriveObjects more liberally
- Add ways for recording software to measure target positions easier
- WRITE USER GUIDE (aka README) so I don't need to explain (and so the explanation makes sense)

Known potential issues:
- RoadRunner may skip past "motors" and therefore ignore DriveObject's system (!)
- No way to recognize end of servo movement (?)

Shortcuts:
- -> means implies
- (?) -> not sure if needed
- (!) -> unsure if system works (aka needs testing)
