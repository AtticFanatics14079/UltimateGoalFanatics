- Finish re-adding features of original DriveObject library

Known potential issues:
- RoadRunner may skip past "motors" and therefore ignore DriveObject's system (!)
- No way to recognize end of servo movement (?)

Shortcuts:
- -> means implies
- (?) -> not sure if needed
- (!) -> unsure if system works (aka needs testing)
