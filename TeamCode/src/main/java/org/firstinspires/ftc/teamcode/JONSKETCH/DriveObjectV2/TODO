- Potentially update time-gated system to simply wait on hardware for maximum efficiency (#)
- Add a backup system to end Sequence threads on stop/crash
- Fix-up PositionThread (again) as it is very clunky and hard to troubleshoot

Known potential issues:
- RoadRunner may skip past "motors" and therefore ignore DriveObject's system (!)
- No way to recognize end of servo movement (?)

Shortcuts:
- -> means implies
- (?) -> not sure if needed
- (!) -> unsure if system works (aka needs testing)
- (#) -> priority fix
